# Memory allocators on C

> A collection of memory allocators built from scratch. It's not advised to use these memory allocators for actual projects, this is a purely theoretical exercise.

## Stack/linear memory allocator

Linear memory allocators assigns contiguous space in memory up to a limit set by a maximum buffer length. Linear memory allocators have to take care of byte allignment.
